# Hospital Database Management System
Database Management System for Hospitals. Utilizes PHP and MySQL, hosted on an Apache Web Server through Wampserver.
1. To run the database, Download Wampserver for Windows (XAMPP for other platforms) and configure localhost (Mostly already configured as 
   default).
2. Modify PHP files and enter your database username and password in the mysqli_connect line of code. This will allow you to make your version 
   of   MySQL a local database for the project.
3.Initialize wampserver, keep mysql open and connected. Move all HTML and PHP pages in the 'WWW' folder present among the wampserver files.
4. To access a certain PHP/HTML page on the server, type 'localhost/[pagename].[extension]' in your browser's searchbar. If the page is present
    in the WWW folder, it will be hosted on the server and any database related operations will be made from the page to your SQL database.
